today I came up with an idea to do 100 days of coding in golang, in my case this is the only way to do something and probably finish it with success. I'll log every day of work here to see how progress looks like. Wish me a luck :D

ok things has changed, intead of making JIRA integration for fetching worklogs I've decided to make Slack Bot for fetching gitlab merge requests for company where I work. I've started with integrating gitlab API, I've used golang library https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab and I have to admit it's well done written. Until today, I have done fetching gitlab Projects and Merge Requests where I'm member of.
